\section{Introduction}

Steel structures constructed in the early days of welding technology used riveted joints consisting of multiple layers of thin plates. Today, the majority of existing riveted bridges are more than 60 years old. Many riveted bridges that have been in service for a long period of time have experienced corrosion damage at the bearing and girder points, where rainwater tends to accumulate, and at the rivet heads, where the coating film is difficult to adhere to. In a previous survey of riveted bridges \cite{okamoto2011investigation}, it was reported that most of the rivet heads were corroded. Therefore, appropriate repair and reinforcement of such corrosion damage is necessary to keep bridges in service safely.

There are three main methods of repairing corroded riveted joints: a: replacement with new rivets, b: replacement with \ac{HSB} pressure joints, and c: replacement with \ac{HSB} friction joints. a: rivet material is difficult to obtain, tools and skilled workers are scarce, and the conditions for on-site installation are severe with respect to fire and noise. b: it is difficult to remove the rivet without losing the rivet hole, and the pressure bolts require high accuracy in bolt diameter. As for point b, it is difficult to remove the rivet without losing the rivet hole when removing the rivet, which is a major problem for pressure bolts with high accuracy requirements for the bolt hole diameter. Therefore, from the viewpoints of workability and economy, it is generally considered that the most effective method is to replace c with a \ac{HSB} for friction welding. However, slip of the friction surface, which is one of the limiting conditions of friction joints, depends greatly on the friction coefficient of the joint surface, but the condition of the joint surface of aged riveted bridges is unknown due to aging. Therefore, it is necessary to confirm whether the slip coefficient specified in the \ac{JSHB} \cite{douji2017} is guaranteed. Therefore, as an efficient repair and reinforcement method, a method that combines load transfer by frictional force and load transfer by bearing pressure at riveted joints has been proposed by using both rivets and \ac{HSB}s, instead of replacing all rivets with \ac{HSB}s. However, sufficient knowledge has not been accumulated on the load carrying capacity and load transfer mechanism of joints using rivets and \ac{HSB}s for friction joints, and design methods have not yet been established for repairing such joints. In fact, as shown in Figure 1, the load transfer mechanisms of friction joints with \ac{HSB}s and riveted joints are different. The road map stipulates that joints with different load transfer mechanisms, such as a joint method that combines a \ac{HSB} friction joint and a rivet joint (hereinafter referred to as HSB-rivet hybrid joint), should not be used because their load transfer mechanisms have not been clarified. Therefore, it is a challenge to elucidate the load transfer mechanism of joints with riveted and \ac{HSB}ed joints that have different jointing methods.

Naito et al. \cite{naito2007basic} conducted tensile tests on riveted joints after 35 years of service by replacing all rivets with \ac{HSB} bearing joints or \ac{HSB} friction joints as a basic performance study. The results showed that the slope of the curve up to the design load for riveted joints was larger than that for riveted joints, \ac{HSB} bearing joints (without preload), and \ac{HSB} friction joints, in that order. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in the slope of the curves of the riveted joints up to the design load in the practical range. This indicates the possibility of replacing old rivets with \ac{HSB}s without changing the surface treatment. However, this study was conducted when the slip coefficient was greater than 0.25, and when the slip coefficient was less than 0.25 [4], it would be difficult to replace all the rivets.

Hashimoto et al. \cite{hashimoto2008} performed FEM analysis of a joint in which a riveted joint was partially replaced by a \ac{HSB} friction joint, and proposed a simple bearing strength calculation formula that cumulates the design slip capacity by \ac{HSB}s and the bearing strength by rivets as indicated in the Design Standard for \ac{RTRI} \cite{rtri2009Design}. This study assumes that the thickness of the main plate is 12mm to 28mm and the materials are SS400 and SM490Y, and focuses on the failure of the rivets rather than the main plate. In addition, the preload introduced into the rivet (hereafter referred to as the rivet preload $N_r$) is not considered.

In a typical riveted bridge, the strength of the riveted material is lower than that of the rivet, and the bearing strength is governed by the strength of the riveted material. In addition, preloads are introduced during actual riveting due to thermal effects. Therefore, material strength and rivet preload are considered to influence the load transfer mechanism and failure mode of the combined joint.

In this study, a three-dimensional elasto-plastic finite displacement analysis was conducted using rivet and \ac{HSB} arrangements as parameters to elucidate the load transfer mechanism of a joint using a riveted joint and a \ac{HSB} friction joint, considering the preload introduced during tightening. In order to focus on the yielding around the rivet holes in the main plate due to the bearinging pressure of the rivets, the plate width b was varied while the plate thickness t was kept constant.

\section{Load transfer mechanism of Rivet-HSB hybrid connections}

\subsection{Finite element (FE) analysis}
\label{ch4sec2}

For the FEM analysis, the general-purpose structural analysis code Abaqus / Standard 2018 \cite{Smith2020} was used to perform a three-dimensional elastoplastic finite displacement analysis. The analytical model is shown in Fig. \ref{fig-femodel-hsbrive} and the analysis cases in Table 1. As shown in Figure 2, the analytical model was part of a two-sided riveted joint at the transverse girder joint of an aged riveted bridge (hereafter referred to as "A bridge"). The joint consists of six rivets per row and three per column on each side. The thickness of the joint is 9.2 mm for the main plate and 12 mm for the bracing plate. The modeling range of the analytical model was one-quarter model in the plate width direction for symmetry. The analytical model was modeled using a three-dimensional, eight-node solid element (reduced integral element) for all of the main plate, the bracing plate, the bolts, and the washers. Boundary nonlinearities were taken into account by setting contact boundaries on the joint surfaces between the main plate and the bracing plate, between the bolt and bolt hole, and between the rivet and rivet hole. The rivet hole is modeled as 23.5 mm so that the rivet and hole wall make contact in advance. When replacing the rivet hole with a \ac{HSB}, the bolt hole is enlarged to 26.5 mm with a clearance of 2.25 mm on each side.

The boundary nonlinearity was modeled using the penalty method for contact and Coulomb friction for friction. In the literature \cite{rtri1992Manual}, it is reported that a slip coefficient of 0.25 to 0.28 can be expected when rivets are replaced with \ac{HSB}s while leaving leadite on the joint surface. On the other hand, in a separate test conducted by the authors to confirm the coefficient of slip of joint surfaces with lead-pan coating, the coefficient of slip at girder joints ranged from 0.15 to 0.38 \cite{Chen2021}. Based on the above, a coefficient of friction of 0.21 was given as the coefficient of friction for the case with lead-pan coating in this analysis, referring to the average value of the coefficient of slip in the literature.

In this study, a total of 14 analytical cases shown in Table \ref{tab-anacase-rivet} were set up using the rivet and \ac{HSB} arrangements and the plate width b of the material to be joined as parameters. The cross-sectional shapes of the analysis cases do not change the bearing strength of the main plate, so the plate thickness and material are not changed, and only the plate width is changed.

For the names of the analysis cases, the number indicates the location of the \ac{HSB}, and y: Net cross-section yielding type and b: bearing yield type indicate the expected serviceability limit state. 

\ac{Fasteners} were positioned from the outside of the joint to the inside as shown in Fig. \ref{fig-femodel-hsbrive}, from \# 1 to \# 3. For example, HSB1-y means a case with one \ac{HSB} at fastener position 1 and a rivet in combination with a yield type. HSBall is a case where all fastener positions \# 1, \# 2, and \# 3 are \ac{HSB}s.

The stress-strain relationships of the materials used in the analysis are shown in Fig. \ref{fig-anarivet-mt} and the mechanical properties in Table \ref{tab-anarivet-mt}. The constitutive law of each material was modeled as a bilinear type with a quadratic stiffness of $E/100 (E=200,000 MPa)$, and the mechanical properties of the main plate and the riveted plate were obtained from material test results cut from the transverse girder of the A Bridge. For the mechanical properties of the rivets, the results of tensile tests \cite{KOMATSU2015} on the rivets of the Hokko Bridge (completed in 1932), which uses the same type of rivets as those of the A Bridge, were used.

In the analysis, initial preloads were introduced to the rivets and \ac{HSB}s in Step 1, and tensile forces due to forced displacement were applied to the end of the material to be joined in Step 2.

The bolt and rivet preloads were introduced in the analysis by setting up a reference section in the center of the rivet and \ac{HSB} shafts and applying initial bolt preloads to the reference section using the bolt loading option in Abaqus / Standard. In subsequent loading steps, the reference section displacement changed by the introduction of the bolt preload is fixed so that changes in the bolt preload can be taken into account. The Poisson's ratio $v$ of the rivet is set to 0 because the rivet's axial diameter is reduced by the Poisson's effect when the preload is introduced and the initial state of bearing between the rivet and rivet hole cannot be reproduced.

For the rivet preload $N_r$ , the literature \cite{Heinemeyer2011TheConnections} reported that the rivet preload depends on the shaft length and that for rivets with a diameter of 22 mm, the rivet preload/rivet shaft yield strength ratio for a shaft length of 33 mm was 0.4 on average and the rivet preload/rivet shaft yield strength ratio for a shaft length of 75 mm was 0.7 on average. The rivet shaft force/rivet shaft yield strength ratio used in Bridge A was reported to be 0.7 on average. The average yield strength of the rivets used in Bridge A is assumed to be 295 MPa \cite{KOMATSU2015}, so rivet shaft forces of 45 kN for a shaft length of 33 mm and 78.5 kN for a shaft length of 75 mm were introduced.
 
\subsubsection{Bearing resistance per Fastener}\label{ch4sec2-1}

The bearing strength, shear capacity and slip capacity per fastener are shown in Table \ref{ch4tab3}.

In the bearing area, plastic flow is unlikely to occur due to the surrounding restraints, and strength above the yield strength can be expected. For this reason, the bearing strength $\sigma_{bs}$ should be 1.5 times the yield strength of the main plate $\sigma_{yp}$ as shown in Equation \ref{eq-sigbs}. In this study, the bearing resistance per rivet $F_{bjr1}$ was calculated from the railroad standard equation \ref{eq-fbs}. The shear strength of the rivets is given by Equation \ref{eq-tauyf}, and the shear yield capacity per rivet, $F_v1$, is calculated from Equation \ref{eq-fsh1}. The slip resistance per fastener $F_{s1}$ is given by Equation \ref{eq-fs1}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq-sigbs}
    \sigma_{bs}=1.5\sigma_{yp}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq-fbs}
    F_{bjr1}=d_f t\sigma_{bs}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq-tauyf}
    \tau_{yf}=\sigma_{yf}/\sqrt{3}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq-fsh1}
    F_{v1}=\pi (0.5d_f)^2 \tau_{yf} m
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq-fs1}
    F_{s1}=\mu m N_f
\end{equation}

where, $\sigma_{bs}$: bearing strength, $\sigma_{yp}$ : yield strength of the main plate, $t$: thickness of the main plate, $d_f$ : diameter of fastener, $F_{bs1}$: bearing resistance of one fastener, $\sigma_{yf}$ : yield strength of the fastener, $\tau_{yf}$ : shear strength of fastener, $F_{sh1}$ : shear resistance of one fastener, $F_{s1}$ : slip resistance of one fastener, $m$ : the number of shear plane, $N_f$ : perload of the fastener.


\subsubsection{Strength of the hybride Joints}

In this chapter, the bearing strength for the service limit was obtained as follows

The slip resistance $F_{slip}$ and the net cross-section yield resistance 
$F_{yp}$ of the joint is calculated from the total value of each fastener in Eq. \ref{fslip-ch4} and Eq. \ref{fyp-ch4} respectively.

\begin{equation}\label{fslip-ch4}
    F_{slip} = \sum F_{s1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{fyp-ch4}
    F_{yp} = (w-d_1)t\times \sigma_{yp}
\end{equation}

where, $F_{slip}$ : slip resistance of the joint, $w$ : width of the main plate, $d1$ : diameter of the hole at outermost fastener.

It is assumed that after the main slip occurs, the frictional resistance force is not taken into account and the load is entirely carried by the bearing resistance in a friction joint \cite{rivet1977}. However, in actual behavior, the frictional resistance force remains to some extent even after slip occurs. On the other hand, the road map and railroad standards do not clearly indicate the limit state of bearing strength in riveted joints.

In the literature \cite{hashimoto2008}, the bearing strength of a combined joint using rivets and \ac{HSB}s was proposed as shown in Eq. \ref{eq-fbhashi}. However, this equation does not take into account the design bearing strength at the service limit and the rivet preload that affects the load transfer condition. On the other hand, the bearing strength of the rivet in Eq. \ref{eq-fbhashi} uses the yield strength of the rivet and focuses on the yield of the rivet shaft, which may not be appropriate when the material to be joined is a thin plate or when the yield strength of the material to be joined is lower than the rivet.

Therefore, this study proposes an improved bearing strength as the design bearing strength of a combined joint that considers the preload of the rivet and focuses on the yield of the rivet hole in the material to be jointed.,$F_{bm}$. The improved bearing strength is proposed as the design bearing strength of the joints with rivet holes. The improved bearing strength $F_{bp}$. is calculated as the sum of the slip capacity and bearing strength of each fastener using Eq. \ref{eq-fbp}. Here, the bearing strength per rivet is not the standard bearing strength of the railroad, but the yield strength of the material to be jointed $1.5σ_y$. but from the yield strength of the material to be jointed $1.0 σ_y$. The bearing strength per rivet is calculated based on the yield strength of the material to be joined, rather than the standard bearing strength of the railway. The effective area of bearing strength assumes that the shaft of the rivet is in contact with the hole and that load is transmitted in the projected area of the rivet shaft.

\begin{equation}\label{eq-fbhashi}
    F_{b,hashimoto}=n_b μmN_b + n_r \times 1.5d_r tσ_yr
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq-fbp}
    F_{bp,rivet}=μm(n_b N_b+n_r N_r)+n_r d_r tσ_y
\end{equation}

where,$F_b.$ : bearing strength by Hashimoto et al.,$F_bp$. : the improved bearing strength proposed in this study, $n_b$: Number of \ac{HSB}s, $n_r$ Number of rivets, $N_b$: preload of high strength bolts. $N_r$ : preload of rivets. $\sigma_{yr}$ : Yield strength of rivet, $σ_y$ : Yield strength of the main plate, $t$ : thickness of the material to be joined, $d_r$: rivet shaft diameter.

\subsection{Results and discussions}

\subsubsection{Limit states strength}

In this study, we focused on the overall displacement of the joint and plasticization around the hole, and defined the service limit state of the joint as the time when the load-overall displacement relationship of the joint begins to exhibit nonlinear behavior. The nonlinear behavior of the joint is governed by the yielding of the rivet hole or the net cross-section.

In this analysis, the bearing load $P_{bya}$ is defined as the load at which all the rivet holes in the main plate yield. Yield of a rivet hole is defined as the time when equivalent plastic strain occurs at all six integration points of the rivet hole wall, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig-posieqqe}. \ac{The net cross-sectional yield load} is defined as the equivalent plastic strain appeared at the whole net cross-sectional location of the side at the end of the bolt position.

Fig. \ref{fig-ls-ch4} shows the relationship between load and equivalent plastic strain of the fastener hole in the riveted HSB0-b joint, and Fig. \ref{fig-ld-htb0b} shows the relationship between load and overall displacement of HSB0-b. As shown in Fig. \ref{fig-femodel-hsbrive}, the overall displacement is the amount of forced displacement applied to the end of the joint.

Fig.\ref{fig-lfhd-ch4} and Fig. \ref{fig-8ch4} show the load-displacement relationship for HSB1-b and the total deformation of the three fastener holes, respectively. Note that the bearing load $P_{bya}$ is plotted as △.

Fig. \ref{fig-ld-htb0b} shows that the bearing strength of HSB0-b ($P_{bya}$ = 245 kN) is comparable to the improved bearing strength proposed in this study ($F_{bp}$ = 249.6 kN). Fig.\ref{fig-lfhd-ch4}, \ref{fig-8ch4} and \ref{fig-9-ch4} show that the load-total displacement relationship for both the riveted and combined joints exhibited nonlinear behavior once the bearing strength load $P_{bya}$ was reached.

Fig. \ref{fig-9-ch4} shows that the degree of plasticization of the rivet holes is not uniform at a bearing load $P_{bya}$ , and is smallest at fastener position 3 and largest at fastener position 1. The $\gamma$ in eq.\ref{ch4-gamma} is used to classify the service limit state of the combined joints as the net cross-sectional yield type when $\gamma$ is greater than 1 and the bearing yield type when $\gamma$ is less than 1. 

\begin{equation}\label{ch4-gamma}
    \gamma = F_y/F_{bp}.

Fig. \ref{ch4fig10} shows that the deformation and failure location of the net cross-section obtained from the FEM analysis were almost consistent with the experimental results. 

Fig. \ref{ch4fig11}.b and \ref{ch4fig12}.b show the case with one \ac{HSB}, while Figures \ref{ch4fig11}.c and \ref{ch4fig12}.c show the enlarged view near the net section yield load for the case with two \ac{HSB}s. Here, the obtained bearing load $P_{bya}$ is indicated by a large symbol. The slope between the load and the overall displacement of the joint is defined as the \ac{Stiffness}, and \ac{The initial stiffness change point} is defined as the time when the entire joint begins to exhibit nonlinear behavior.

The relationship between load and relative displacement for the Net cross-section yielding and bearing yielding cases are shown in Fig. \ref{ch4fig13} and Fig. \ref{ch4fig14}, respectively. The relative displacement on the horizontal axis is the relative displacement in the direction of load between the bracing plate and the welded material at a position 10 mm from the edge of the welded material on the play side at the joint cover surface.

\subsubsection{Net cross-section yielding type}

Fig. \ref{ch4fig11} shows that the initial stiffness of the riveted joints (HSB0-y) is lower than that of the combined and friction joints (HSBall-y), and in all cases, net cross-section yielding occurred at the point of initial stiffness change.

Fig. \ref{ch4fig11-b} shows that the load at the initial stiffness change point was the same for all cases with a single \ac{HSB} (HSB1-y, 2-y, 3-y), but the slope of the curve after that point was larger for the case with the \ac{HSB} placed at fastener position 1 (HSB1), the net cross-section position. This is considered to be due to the fact that when the \ac{HSB} is placed at fastener position 1, the load transfer by frictional force outside the net cross-sectional position is larger.

Fig. \ref{ch4fig11-c} shows that the initial stiffness of the cases with two \ac{HSB}s (HSB13-y, 23-y, and 12-y) is the same as that of the HSB friction joint (HSBall-y). However, the initial stiffness change point and subsequent stiffnesses were lower for HSB-23-y, where only fastener position 1 was not replaced, than for the other cases with two \ac{HSB}s and HSBall-y. The behavior after net cross-sectional yielding showed that HSBall-y experienced a drop in load when the load was 243 kN. This was due to the preload loss of the \ac{HSB} caused by net cross-section yielding, which resulted in slippage. However, for HSB13-y and HSB12-y, the slope change of the curve near the slip capacity was small because the load was transmitted by the bearing pressure of the rivets even after the slip capacity was exceeded.

Fig. \ref{ch4fig13} shows that the slope between load and relative displacement before the net section yield load was exceeded was the smallest for HSB0-y and was similar for HSBall-y and the combined joint. The initial relative displacement increment was smaller for the combined joints when the \ac{HSB} was used as the fastener closer to the location where the relative displacement was obtained.

    \caption{Relationship between load and relative displacement (Net cross-section yielding type)}
    \label{ch4fig13}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Bearing yield type}

Fig. \ref{ch4fig12} shows that the initial stiffness of the case with two \ac{HSB}s (HSB23-b) was similar to that of the friction-jointed HSBall-b. For HSBall-b, the displacement increased while the load decreased at 263.7 kN, and the analytical values generally agreed with the sliding capacity, $F_{slip}$  = 258.3 kN. In the case of the combined joint, the load increased even when the slip capacity was exceeded, and the displacement increment was small.

From Fig. \ref{ch4fig12-b}, \ref{ch4fig12-c}, the curves after exceeding the bearing pressure load $P_{bya}$ (indicated by the larger plots) (overall displacement of 1mm~3mm) were at the top for the riveted joint (HSB0-b) and at the bottom for the HSB23-b case. This is because there are three rivets resisting bearing force in the riveted joints, and in the HSB23-b case, the load is resisted by the bearing force per rivet and the friction of two \ac{HSB}s before the \ac{HSB}s enter the bearing force.

Fig. \ref{ch4fig14} shows that in all cases, the point of change in the slope of the curve of the relative displacement-load relationship (indicated by the large plot) was equivalent to the slip capacity $F_{slip}$ . In addition, HSBall-b, which was frictionally joined with \ac{HSB}s, exhibited clear slippage, while the other joints with rivets did not exhibit slippage.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{imgs/ch4/fig14.pdf}
    \caption{Relationship between load and relative displacement (bearing yield type)}
    \label{ch4fig14}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Load Transfer Mechanism}

As shown in Fig. \ref{ch4fig15}, the combined joint transmits loads through three processes: (1) a friction transmission phase in which loads are transmitted almost exclusively by friction up to a slip capacity $F_{slip}$ , (2) a combined transmission phase in which loads are transmitted by bearing pressure and friction up to a bearing load $P_{bya}$ , and (3) a plastic deformation phase in which the joint is plastically deformed afterwards.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{imgs/ch4/fig15.pdf}
    \caption{Schematic diagram of a hybrid joint.}
    \label{ch4fig15}
\end{figure}

The initial stiffness is determined in the friction transfer phase. The slope of the curve in the combined transfer phase is constant, although it is less than the initial stiffness, and represents the elastic behavior in the bearing state. The slope of the curve then changes and exhibits non-linearity when the bearing load $P_{bya}$ is exceeded in the case of the pressure-precedence type and when the net sectional yield load $F_y$ is exceeded in the case of the yield type. This is considered to be due to the development of plasticization in the bearing state or plasticization in the entire width direction of the net cross-sectional position.

Fig. \ref{ch4fig16} shows the normalized load displacement relationship for the bearing yield and Net cross-section yielding types of combined joints. The vertical axis is non-dimensionalized using the analytical load Fa , which is the minimum value of the net section yield load, slip load, and bearing load in each case obtained from the analysis.

    \caption{Relationship between load and the relative displacement of each position}
    \label{ch4fig17}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{ch4fig16} shows that the slope of the curve after $F / F_a = 1$ is higher for the bearing yield type than for the Net cross-section yielding type. The amount of elongation is relatively small because the deformation of the Net cross-section yielding type is localized until the maximum load is reached.

Fig. \ref{ch4fig17} shows the relationship between local relative deformation and load for HSB1-b. HSB-1, Rivet-2, and Rivet-3 show the relative displacement of the bonding plate and the bonded material at the center position of the fastener on each of the cover surfaces. The hole deformation (total) shows the sum of the hole deformations of all fastener holes.

Fig. \ref{ch4fig17} shows that the relative displacements of the contact plate and the welded material at the center of each fastener were about the same, which confirms that no localized slippage occurred. The relative displacement at 10 mm from the edge of the joint is almost equal to the sum of the hole deformation, and it can be judged that the amount of bearing deformation and relative displacement of the joint behaves almost the same. In other cases, the results were similar to those of HSB1.

This indicates that the combined riveted and HSB friction joints do not exhibit slip and that the relative deformation calculated from the hole deformation of the joint and the main plate due to bearing deformation is the same as the relative displacement calculated from the displacement of the jointed plate and the main plate's faying surfaces. 

Fig. \ref{ch4fig18} shows the load sharing at ratios $F / P_{bya}$ = 0.25, 0.5, 1 for tensile load $F$ and bearing load $P_{bya}$. The hole deformation in the loading direction at $F / P_{bya}$ = 0.5, 1 is shown in Fig. \ref{ch4fig19}. The bearing resistance force is the contact force between the fastener shaft and the fastener hole in the material to be joined in the load direction, and the friction resistance force is the shear friction force acting on the contact surface between the bracing plate and the material to be joined. It is confirmed that the total force of bearing resistance and friction resistance is equal to the total load.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/ch4/fig18.pdf}
\caption{Load sharing of each case (bearing yield type)}
\label{ch4fig18}
\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{ch4fig18} shows that when $F / P_{bya}$ = 0.25, the riveted and combined joints resisted almost entirely by friction, and the load sharing increased when the \ac{HSB} was placed outside the joint, with HSB1-b sharing 35.1 kN (more than half the total load), HSB2-b 20.7 kN (less than half the total load), and HSB3-b sharing about 45\% of the total load. The load-bearing strength of HSB2-b was 20.7 kN (more than half of the total load) and that of HSB3-b was about 45%.

When $F / P_{bya}$ = 0.5, cases HSB2-b and HSB3-b without a \ac{HSB} at fastener position 1 resisted 16.4\% and 11\% of the total load, respectively, but in both cases most of the bearing pressure was shared by the rivets at outer fastener position 1. On the other hand, the load sharing for HSB1-b was the same as when $F / P_{bya}$ = 0.25. When a \ac{HSB} was placed at fastener position 1 in the bearing yield type, the bearing pressure of the rivets did not carry most of the load, and the load was shared through the frictional force of each fastener.

When $F / P_{bya}$ = 1, each fastener exceeded the slip capacity per fastener in all cases. In addition, the load carried by fastener position 1 was about 35\% of the total load, and the load carried by each fastener was almost equally distributed. The friction of the \ac{HSB}s and the bearing pressure of the rivets worked together to resist the load.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/ch4/fig19.pdf}
\caption{Fastener hole deformation $\delta_{hd}$ of each case (bearing yield type)}
\label{ch4fig19}
\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{ch4fig19} further illustrates the fastener hole deformation $\delta_{hd}$ in each case at $F / P_{bya}$ = 0.5 and 1. At $F / P_{bya}$ = 0.5, the deformation of the fastener holes in HSB0-b, HSB1-b, and HSB2-b gradually decreases from fastener position 1 to position 3. For example, in HSB0-b, the deformation at position 1 is 0.053 mm, which is significantly larger than the deformation at position 3 (0.013 mm). Similarly, in HSB1-b, position 1 experiences a deformation of 0.034 mm, while position 3 shows only 0.01 mm. This trend indicates that the load is concentrated at fastener position 1, resulting in greater deformation at this location.

When $F / P_{bya}$ = 1, the deformation of the fastener holes increases compared to $F / P_{bya}$ = 0.5, but the distribution pattern remains consistent. In HSB0-b, the deformation at position 1 reaches 0.108 mm, while position 3 shows a smaller deformation of 0.032 mm. A similar trend is observed in HSB1-b and HSB2-b, where the deformation at position 1 is significantly higher than at positions 2 and 3. Notably, in HSB3-b, the deformation at position 3 is negligible (close to 0), indicating that the load is primarily resisted by the fasteners at positions 1 and 2. This result aligns with the load-sharing behavior shown in Fig. \ref{ch4fig18}, where fastener position 1 carries a significant portion of the load.

From a combined analysis of Fig. \ref{ch4fig18} and Fig. \ref{ch4fig19}, it can be concluded that the load-sharing behavior and the corresponding fastener hole deformations are highly dependent on the placement of the \ac{HSB} and the fastener positions. When the \ac{HSB} is placed at fastener position 1, the load is more evenly distributed among the fasteners, leading to reduced deformation at the outer fastener positions. Conversely, when the \ac{HSB} is absent at position 1, the load is concentrated at this location, resulting in greater deformation of the fastener holes. At $F / P_{bya}$ = 1, the slip capacity of each fastener is exceeded, and the combined action of friction and bearing resistance ensures load sharing among the fasteners. The deformation trends in Fig. \ref{ch4fig19} validate the load-sharing patterns observed in Fig. \ref{ch4fig18}, highlighting the critical role of fastener placement and \ac{HSB} configuration in optimizing joint performance.

\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{fig-fastime} shows the relationship between load and friction/bearing forces. The dotted lines F1 -- F3 represent the frictional forces applied by fasteners 1, 2, and 3, and the solid lines B1~B3 represent the bearing forces applied by fasteners 1, 2, and 3, with X, □, and △ representing fasteners 1 through 3, respectively.

Fig. \ref{fig-fastime} shows that the frictional force due to the rivets did not decrease in any case up to the bearing load, because the bearing deformation of the rivets and the yield deformation of the welded material were slight. On the other hand, after $F / P_{bya}  = 1.25$, the frictional force due to the rivets gradually decreased for HSB1-b and HSB2-b. Therefore, the rivet frictional force can resist the load until the bearing load is reached in the combined use joint.

In the case where a \ac{HSB} is placed at fastener position 1 (HSB1-b), the frictional force shared by each fastener increases linearly, there is almost no load sharing by the bearing force before the sliding capacity, and the rigidity of the entire joint is high.



\section{Load redistribution mechanism after replaced the rivet}

Analysis conditions and modeling methods are consistent with the previous section, using the same modeling and meshing methods. The material properties of bolts, rivets, and steel plates are also the same.

% The model was developed in Abaqus, and the FE mesh and boundary conditions imposed are shown in Fig. \ref{fig-l5}. To simulate the dead load, distributed loads were applied to the joint end surface. The elements applied in the model were  \ac{C3D8R}.

% The mechanical properties and stress–strain curves of the steel plates, rivets, and bolts are shown in Table \ref{tab-l1} and Fig. \ref{fig-l6}. Material properties were used nominal values of recommendation by Japanese Industrial Standards. In fact, the properties were based on the rivets and steel plates used in the target bridge, as well as those of \ac{HSB}s utilized in most Japanese bridges.

% It is previously demonstrated that a clamping force exists in rivets and that it is positively correlated with the rivet shank length \cite{Leonetti2020RivetBridges}. However, significant scattering occurs in the clamping force generated by each rivet, and bridge designers generally disregard the clamping force of the rivet. The clamping force generated by the rivet was not considered in the present study to simplify the evaluation of the rivet transfer force.

% A penalty friction formulation from Abaqus was used in the FE model to simulate the Coulomb friction behavior. In the Chapter \ref{ch3}, the slip test was conducted for 90-year-old riveted joints, and the results showed that the average slip coefficient
% of the riveted joints was 0.27. The friction coefficient between the connected and cover plates in this model was set to the same value of 0.27.

\subsection{FE analysis case}

To elucidate the load redistribution mechanism of the joint when individual rivets are replaced, the location of the replaced rivet was analyzed in the present study. Table \ref{tab-l2} shows the analysis cases, where RP1 represents the replacement of rivet \# 1.

Table \ref{tab-l3} lists the riveted joint's (RP0) design resistance. Both the riveted joint and the hybrid joint was failure by cross-sectional fracture. The net cross-section yield resistance $F_{y}$, ultimate net cross section resistance $F_{u}$, ultimate bearing resistance $F_{b}$, and ultimate rivet shear resistance $F_v$ are calculated using flowing equation.

\begin{equation*}
    F_y = (w-d_0)tf_y

    F_u = (w-d_0)tf_u

\begin{equation*}
    F_u = nmA_sf_{ur}

\subsection{Analysis process step}

A step analysis was conducted in this study to evaluate the load redistribution within the riveted joint after removing the individual rivets. The steps involved in the analysis are summarized in Table \ref{tab-l4}.

\begin{table}[htbp]

\end{table}

The dead load was 72.5 kN, as calculated from the design dead load stress of the rivet girder's cross section. In step 2, the model change interaction was conducted in Abaqus to reproduce the rivet removal. In step 3, the bolt was installed and tightened to 205 kN. In step 4, the forced displacement was used to apply the live load. The stress contour maps for each step are shown in Fig. \ref{fig-l7}.

\subsection{Results and discussions}

\subsubsection{Load sharing of each rivet (step 2)}

Fig. \ref{fig-l8} shows the load distribution of each fastener before and after rivet removal. The vertical axis represents the bearing resistance of each rivet, and the horizontal axis represents the rivet position. The green / orange bars represent the bearing resistance of the rivet before and after a
certain rivet is removed.

    \caption{Load sharing of each fastener within dead load (before and after removing rivet)}
    \label{fig-l8}
\end{figure}

Table \ref{tab-l5} shows the load redistribution among the remaining rivets after the removal of an individual rivet.

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \caption{Load redistribution of removed riveted [\%]}\label{tab-l5}
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{imgs/ch4/tab-l5.pdf}
\end{table}

The bearing resistance of each rivet was calculated using the contact pressure on the rivet hole surface. The friction resistance of the bolt was calculated using the frictional stress on the top surface. The hole and top surfaces are shown in Fig. \ref{fig-l9}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{imgs/ch4/fig-l9.pdf}
    \caption{Location where bearing/friction resistance is calculated}
    \label{fig-l9}
\end{figure}

As shown in Fig. \ref{fig-l8}.a, the bearing resistance (24.53 kN) originally transferred by rivet \#1 was redistributed among the remaining four rivets. Approximately 51\% (12.6 kN / 24.53 kN) of the bearing resistance of rivet \#1 was transferred to rivet \#2, which was the closest rivet to \#1. The bearing resistance of rivet \#2 increased from 13.28 to 25.88 kN. The bearing resistances of rivets \#3, \#4, and \#5 were redistributed by 26\% (6.38 kN / 24.53 kN), 13.7\%, and 8.7\% of the \#1 rivet bearing resistance, respectively.

In addition, it was discovered that the removal of rivet \#1 was based a similar load redistribution mechanism to that of the removal of rivet \#5, as shown in Table \ref{tab-l5}.

As shown in Fig. \ref{fig-l8}.c, removing middle rivet \#3 caused its bearing resistance to be distributed evenly among the remaining rivets.

\subsubsection{Resistance of each fastener}

Fig. \ref{fig-l10} shows the relationship between each fastener's reaction force and displacement for each case from steps 2 to 4. $P_{s1}$ is the maximum reaction force of the bolt. In step 2, the residual deformation due to the dead load was disregarded, and loading was commenced from 0 kN.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/ch4/fig-l10.pdf}
    \caption{Relationship between each fastener's reaction force and displacement}
    \label{fig-l10}
\end{figure}

As shown in Fig. \ref{fig-l10}, before the bolt's resistance reached $P_{s1}$, rivets near the replaced rivet were affected more by the newly fastened bolt, thereby rendering the rivet's load transfer less efficient. efficient. Meanwhile, the rivets distant from the bolt were almost unaffected. For example, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig-l10}.a, where rivet \#1 was replaced by a bolt, the curve of rivet \#5 barely changed, and the slope of rivet \#2 decreased after the rivet was replaced.

When the reaction force of the bolt exceeded $P_{s1}$, the bolt no longer transferred forces. Meanwhile, the curves of the rivets that were adjacent to the bolt changed, resulting in a more efficient load transfer. However, the more distant rivets were unaffected.

\subsubsection{Overall mechanical behavior}

Fig. \ref{fig-l11} shows the relationship between load and displacement for each case. As shown in the figure, the overall mechanical behavior was similar to that of RP0 and RP1. This might be because in RP1, bolt \#1 transferred more load to the cover plate via friction, thereby relieving the net cross-section stress in the connected plate.

\section{Load transfer mechanism for long riveted joint}

In the previous section, in the case of a hybrid joint using three rows of rivets and a \ac{HSB} friction connection, although nonlinear behavior is not exhibited until the inner rivet holes plasticize, the degree of plasticization is not uniform and the plasticization zone increases as one moves away from the center of the joint. However, when the number of rivet rows is small, as in the case of the subject studied in section \ref{ch4sec2}, the plasticization bias at each rivet position is small, and it is considered possible to evaluate the plasticization of the rivet holes at the initial stage of nonlinear behavior by multiplying the nominal bearing stress by the number of rivets. However, which discusses only one-row, three-row joints, the number of rivets in a row actually increases, the force acting on the rivets is not uniform, and there is a large possibility that localized yielding will occur first.

\subsection{FE analysis}

Fig. \ref{fig-femodl-5r} shows the FE analysis model and the dimension of the joint. The analysis case are shown in Table \ref{tab-5rcase}, the rivets were replaced with \ac{HSB}s and the position and number of rivets were used as parameters in the analysis.

The analytical model consists of a total of five rivets. The modeling range of the analytical model is 1/4 model in the direction of the plate width for symmetry. The analytical model consists of an C3D8R (reduced integral element) for the joint, splice plate, bolt, and washer. Faying surfaces were set on the joint surfaces between the jointed material and splice plate, bolt and bolt hole, and rivet and rivet hole, and boundary nonlinearities were considered. The rivet hole was modeled as 23.5 mm so that the rivet and the hole wall were in contact beforehand. When replacing the rivet with a \ac{HSB}, the bolt hole was left at 23.5 mm.

In the analysis, an initial axial force was introduced to the rivet and \ac{HSB} in Step 1, and a tensile force due to forced displacement was applied to the end of the material to be welded in Step 2. Although some axial force was actually introduced due to cooling and shrinkage of the rivet, this force was not taken into account in the analysis. However, this axial force was not taken into account in this analysis.

The conditions of material properties and coefficient of friction used for the analysis are the same as in the previous section.

\subsection{Result and discussions}

\subsubsection{Displacement}

Fig.\ref{fig-5rld} shows the The relationship between load and displacement of all the 5-row case. The location of the load and displacement acquisition is where the forced displacement is given.

The initial stiffness of the joint depends on the number of \ac{HSB}s. The higher the number of \ac{HSB}s, the higher the initial stiffness of the joint. This is consistent with the results in section \ref{ch4sec2}. In the R0B5 case, slip was observed, but in the case with rivets, no slip was observed because the joint was transmitting the load by bearing. In the case with rivets and joints with rivets, the joint begins to exhibit nonlinear behavior when the displacement is about 1.8 mm. This nonlinear behavior is considered to be caused by the deformation of the hole due to yielding around the hole in the main plate. The more fasteners resist the load by bearing, the smaller the load on the fastener hole. Finally, when the \ac{HSB} also enters a bearing transfer state, the stiffness of the joint depends on the shear yield of the rivets, since the shear yield of the rivets is lower than the net cross-sectional yield of the joint. Still, the maximum load on the joint depends on the number of rivets in the joint. This may be due to shear yielding of the rivets before the maximum load is reached.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Stress distribution}

Fig.\ref{fig-5rslscount} shows the mises stress contour plot when each case begins to exhibit nonlinear behavior. When the joint begins to exhibit nonlinear behavior, the area around the hole in the main plate develops a plastic zone, but it does not develop to the gross section of the plate. On the other hand, the shaft of each rivet develops a plastic zone at the shear position. It was found that the nonlinear behavior in each case depends on the shear yield of the rivets. It can be confirmed from the contour plots that when the nonlinear behavior begins, the \ac{HSB} of the joint is not yet in a bearing state, and the stress around the hole in the main plate to the HSB is small. In the R0B5 case, there is no stress around the hole due to bearing pressure because of the occurrence of slip in the nonlinear behavior.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{imgs//ch4/fig-5rslscount.pdf}
    \caption{Mises stress contour plot when each case begins to exhibit nonlinear behavior}
    \label{fig-5rslscount}
\end{figure}

In the riveted joints, the plastic zone at the rivet axis is smaller than in other cases during linear behavior, but the stress in the welded material is relatively high. Especially at the edge, there is a clear tendency for the plastic zone to extend to the edge. Failure due to bearing of the joined material may occur at an early stage.


Fig.\ref{fig-5rulscount} shows the mises stress contour plot of each case when max load. It can be determined that the maximum load of the riveted and hybrid joint depends on the shear yield of the rivet. The rivet shaft is in the plastic zone and the tensile strength of the rivet is close to the rivet's ultimate strength $f_{ur}$ at the maximum load. The ultimate failure of the rivet is assumed to be the rivet shear rupture. On the other hand, in the \ac{HSB} friction joint case, the shaft of the \ac{HSB} did not yet develop a plastic zone, but developed a plastic zone around the hole in the main plate up to the gross section of the plate. In the \ac{HSB} friction joint case, it can be inferred that the final failure is either net cross-sectional rupture or end shear failure of the main plate. 

The stress propagation in the plastic zone around the hole is different for each case, and the stress propagation is small from the outside to the inside of the joint. The direction of the plastic zone changes depending on the number of \ac{HSB}s replaced. In the case of rivet and single rivet replacement, the plastic zone tended to propagate toward the center of the plate width on the tensile side. In the case of R2B3, the plastic zone tended to propagate in the diagonal direction.

\subsubsection{Deformation of the hole}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{imgs//ch4/fig-5rholedef.pdf}
    \caption{The deformation of each case each fastener's hole}
    \label{fig-5rholedef}
\end{figure}

Fig.\ref{fig-5rholedef} shows the deformation of each case each fastener's hole. The vertical axis is the hole deformation at each fastener hole, and the horizontal axis is the overall load. The bearing deformations of the riveted and \ac{HSB} friction joints are almost equal. However, in the case of a hybrid joint, the changes in the deformations of the holes in the rivets and \ac{HSB}s are also different because the load-transfer mechanism is different. From Fig.\ref{fig-5rholedef} b, c, and d, the rate of change in the bearing deformation of the holes in the rivets is almost equal, and bearing deformation occurs at an earlier stage than that of the \ac{HSB}s. In all cases, when the average value reaches 5\%, the hole in the rivet has already exceeded 5\% of the deformation before that. Since the change in hole deformation is not uniform, the use of the average value to determine the limit state of the joint is a concern. The deformation of the hole in each rivet must be taken into account.



\section{Conclusions}

In this chapter, FE analysis was conducted using rivet and \ac{HSB} arrangements as parameters to elucidate the load transfer mechanism of a joint involving both riveted and \ac{HSB} friction joints, with preloads considered during tightening. By focusing on the yielding around the rivet holes in the main plate due to bearing pressure and varying the plate width \(b\) while maintaining a constant plate thickness \(t\), the displacement of the joint, load sharing of each fastener, and stress properties of the main plate were analyzed to clarify the load transfer mechanism of the combined riveted and \ac{HSB} friction joints.

\subsubsection*{Load transfer and deformation mechanisms}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The overall displacement and plastic deformation around the fastener hole were analyzed, and the service limit state of the joint was defined as the point where the load-overall displacement relationship exhibited nonlinear behavior. It was found that the arrangement of \ac{HSB}s had almost no effect on the service condition of the three-row joints.
    \item In the pressure-precedence type, where the critical service condition is determined by the bearing pressure, all rivet holes yielded when the load-total displacement relationship of the entire joint became nonlinear.
    \item In hybrid joints, load transfer occurs in three phases: (1) friction transfer up to the slip capacity $F_{slip}$, (2) combined transfer by bearing pressure and friction up to the bearing pressure load $P_{bya}$, and (3) plastic deformation after yielding. Hybrid joints increase initial stiffness compared to riveted joints and relieve bearing stress on rivets through frictional load transfer via the contact plate.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Load redistribution mechanism when removing rivets}
\begin{itemize}
    \item When an end rivet (e.g., rivet \#1 or \#5) was removed, half of the removed rivet's load was transferred to the nearest rivet, with less load transferred to more distant rivets.
    \item When the middle rivet (e.g., rivet \#3) was removed, load redistribution was more uniform across the remaining rivets.
    \item Replacing a rivet with a bolt affected load transfer primarily in nearby rivets, while distant rivets were largely unaffected. For example, replacing rivet \#1 with a bolt increased frictional load transfer to the cover plate, reducing net cross-section stress in the connected plate.
\end{itemize}
