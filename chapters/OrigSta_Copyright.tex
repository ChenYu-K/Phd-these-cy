This research started in April 2021 with the goal to obtain the Ph.D degree in Urban Engineering (Bridge Engineering Lab.) at the Osaka City University. This research investigated the load transfer mechanism, resistance and limit states of hybrid joint with friction type and bearing type connections. The results are based on both experimental and FE analyses.

%论文分别参考了欧洲的eurocode3，美国的aashto，中国和日本的设计标准，对承压式连接进行了深度的讨论。承压式连接能够提供更高的强度，然而极限设计法中各国对于承压式连接的设计都非常暧昧，除了对于强度极限状态的设计有明确的规定，对于使用极限状态大多数标准都没有给出明确的定义。日本的设计标准虽然对承压式连接给出了设计方法，然而这是基于ASD方法的延用，对于接头的变形等没有做出充分的讨论。因此本研究首先着重于讨论了承压式连接，然后讨论了其与摩擦式连接共同作用时接头的变形以及强度。
The thesis provides an in-depth discussion of bearing connections with reference to Eurocode 3 in Europe, AASHTO in the USA, and design standards in China and Japan, respectively. The bearing connection can provide higher bearing resistance, however, the limit state design method is very ambiguous for the design of bearing type connection in all countries, except for the design of ultimate (strength) limit state, most of the standards do not give a clear definition for the serviceability limit state. Although the Japanese design standard gives a design method for bearing type connection in SLS, it is based on the extension of the ASD method, and the deformation of the joint is not sufficiently discussed. Therefore, this study firstly focuses on the bearing connection, and then discusses the deformation and bearing resistance of the joint when it acts together with the friction connection.

%本论文的部分内容是作者在代尔夫特理工大学进行研究访问期间撰写的，在进行关于注射螺栓的共同研究时，获得了许多关于混合连接的灵感。
Parts of this thesis were written during the author's research visit to the Delft University of Technology, where many inspirations for hybrid connections were gained while carrying out joint research on injection bolts.
