abstract = {When assessing the structural safety of historical metal structures, the understanding of the construction materials, their properties and modes of construction is a prior concern. Available information on historical riveted connections, however, is very limited. Analyzing the present state of these connections to better understand their actual structural behaviour is therefore essential. Through experimental work, we investigated the geometry and metallography of wrought-iron rivets dismantled from four bridges and buildings (1880s–1890s). The experimental results were then compared to historical literature. This paper reports the original design, manufacturing and installation of hot-driven rivets through four case studies and discusses the impact of these parameters on the behaviour of the connections. Results showed that the geometrical affinity of rivets together with their grain flow allow the original design and driving technique to be identified. The provided findings constitute supportive tools when assessing and renovating historical riveted structures.}

    abstract = { This paper presented a new retrofit system for strengthening the stringer-to-floor-beam double-angle connections in a 92-year-old riveted railway bridge in Switzerland, using prestressed carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) rods. The strengthening system transmitted the forces purely through friction, with minimum interference with bridge traffic. The system consisted of two components: a newly developed mechanical wedge-barrel anchor to hold the prestressed CFRP rod and a clamping system attaching the stringer flange. The strengthening system reduced the out-of-plane deformation of the connections, resulting in a reduction in the distortion-induced stresses in the connections. The short-term bridge measurements showed that the application of a total prestressing force of 100 kN reduced the dominant mean stress in the connection hotspot by 47\% (from 22.9 to 10.9 MPa) under the passage of passenger trains, whereas the stress range remained unchanged. Using the modified Wöhler curve method (MWCM) as a critical plane-based multiaxial fatigue model, the strengthening system was observed to reduce the multiaxial mean stress parameter by 30\% under the passenger train loads. The long-term monitoring of the strengthening system, using a wireless sensor network (WSN) system, indicated no prestress loss in the CFRP rods during the seven-month period since its installation. }

abstract = {Steel railway bridges of all types comprise a large portion of the infrastructure inventory of several countries. Due to the ageing of these structures and increasing traffic loadings, structural fatigue increasingly became an important concern, leading to bridges deterioration. In this context, it is well-known that welded connections are among the weakest locations in steel bridges since they are prone to stress concentrations leading to the initiation of fatigue cracks. Although its importance, the study of the development history of welding technology applied to steel bridges is often overlooked in introductory texts about fatigue of metallic bridges. However, to understand the historical development of welding in steel bridges construction and its impact on fatigue design is fundamental, mainly because fatigue evaluation depends on the age of structures. The goal of this paper is to review the history of fatigue cracking of welded railway bridges, discussing the structural behaviour of welded bridges under dynamic traffic loads and the different causes of fatigue damage of welded connections. The presented case studies cover a period from the beginning of application of welding to steel bridges in the 1930s, revisiting well-known cases of cracks documented in the literature due to their historic relevance and presenting also recent cases of the last decades due to new traffic conditions related to Heavy Traffic Loads (HAL) and High-Speed Trains. For this purpose, an in-depth literature review covering more than one-century history was carried out, providing a multidisciplinary analysis with insights into the welding history and practice and fatigue of welded joints, especially applied to steel railway bridges.}

ABSTRACT = {This paper reviews the results of a comprehensive investigation including more than 100 fatigue damage cases, reported for steel and composite bridges. The damage cases are categorized according to types of detail. The mechanisms behind fatigue damage in each category are identified and studied. It was found that more than 90% of all reported damage cases are of deformation-induced type and generated by some kind of unintentional or otherwise overlooked interaction between different load-carrying members or systems in the bridge. Poor detailing, with unstiffened gaps and abrupt changes in stiffness at the connections between different members were also found to contribute to fatigue cracking in many details.},

During the World War II the bridge was exploded and has been restored later after the war (1946). The original design documentation was lost. The aim of this study is to investigate the structural condition and the behaviour of the riveted steel truss bridge with the aid of full-scale static and dynamic testing. The field load tests have been conducted to develop an analytical model, to be used for assessment of bridge capacity. Static and dynamic tests of the bridge using two original locomotives were performed. Supplementary dynamic tests using impulse excitation were also carried out. The responses (stresses, static and dynamic displacements, accelerations, mode shapes, corresponding resonant frequencies and modal damping values) of bridge superstructure were determined. Research has shown that the bridge exhibit sufficient reserve of capacity for safe operation.}

abstract="When operating load-bearing building structures, there is often a need to strengthen the bolted connection, if the connection has a lack of load-bearing capacity. This may be due to increased loads on the structure or damage to the connection (for example, as a result of corrosion). The method of strengthening the bolted connection with welds, therefore, has obvious practical significance, and the combined bolt and weld-in connection has its own field of application. Many authors devoted their works to studies of combined connections, which use the joint work of friction bonds in the form of prestressed high-strength bolts and bonds in the form of welds. However, connections on conventional, non-prestressed bolts, which are affected by shear forces, are still of interest for research. The subject of research in them is the joint work in one connection of two types of bonds---bolts and welds, each of which has a significantly different deformability. The paper presents the results of testing physical samples of bolt and weld-in connections and computer research of their numerical models. The impact of preloading on the load-bearing capacity of combined bolt and weld-in connections is revealed. The load-bearing capacity criterion for numerical models was adopted on the basis of the deformation compatibility of numerical simulation samples and physical tests.",

Provisions for the design of these combination joints can be found in existing specifications, but the design rules generally have not been verified by physical tests. In addition, the rules appear to be illogical in some cases. An experimental study using full-scale tension lap splices that combined high-strength bolts and fillet welds was carried out in order to develop a better understanding of combination joints. The results showed that the orientation of the welds and the bearing condition of the bolts are two key factors that must be considered when determining the extent of load sharing in combination joints. Design recommendations based on the results of this study are presented. }

abstract = {This paper quantifies the reliability level of connections combining slip-critical bolts and longitudinal fillet welds using a probabilistic approach that integrates finite element (FE) modeling, meta-modeling, and Monte Carlo simulation. The proposed approach relies on experimental results to calibrate a FE model and quantify the uncertainties associated with various input parameters. The calibrated FE model is next integrated into a low-rank tensor approximation process to provide the variance-based sensitivity measures associated with the considered random variables. The influential variables, along with the calibrated FE model, are then used to evaluate the reliability by means of accelerated Kriging Monte Carlo simulation (AK-MCS). Finally, the proposed approach is applied to combination bolted-welded connections under direct tension to evaluate their reliability considering different faying surface conditions. The results of the conducted sensitivity analysis indicate that variability in weld geometry, bolt pretensioning forces, and friction coefficient of steel surface would significantly contribute to the variability of the load-carrying capacity of the investigated connections. In addition, the reliability of the combination connections with Class A and B faying surfaces is evaluated based on code provisions.}

  abstract = {The purpose of this book is to provide background information and criteria that can be used as a guide to the improvement of existing design procedures and specifications for bolted and riveted joints. To achieve this goal, extensive research work performed in the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, the Nether- lands, England, Norway, Japan, and elsewhere was reviewed. Among the criteria considered as a basis for design was an evaluation of the load versus deformation characteristics of the component parts of the joint. The major emphasis was placed on the behavior of structural joints connected by ASTM A325 or A490 high-strength bolts. The joint materials considered ranged from structural carbon steel with a specified yield stress between 33 and 36 ksi (227 and 248 MPa) to quenched and tempered alloy steel with a yield stress ranging from 90 to 100 ksi (620 to 689 MPa). The different types of fasteners, connections, loading conditions, and design procedures are discussed briefly in the first two chapters. Chapters 3 and 4 deal with the behavior of individual fasteners under various loading conditions. Chapter 5 describes the behavior, analysis, and design of symmetric butt splices. Special types of joints such as truss-type connections, shingle joints, beam or girder splices, and beam-to-column connections are discussed in subsequent chapters.},
